                    <h4>Call for Participation</h4>
                    <p>We invite you to participate in the CHI 2025 Workshop on Designing Tangible Interaction with State-of-the-Art Computer Vision. The one-day workshop aims to create a research agenda for extending the existing computer vision (CV) infrastructure for building tangible user interfaces (TUI). Existing CV-based TUI toolkits, such as reactivision, have facilitated the development of event-driven tangible interactions. However, recent surveys have revealed that these toolkits are no longer keeping pace with emerging capabilities in CV. As a result, recent TUI projects increasingly rely on bespoke implementation and one-off integration, hindering reproducibility and sustainability in the long run. Therefore, this workshop aims to take a co-creation approach to address six key questions, including leveraging existing infrastructure, generating new interactions, promoting sustainable practices, enabling context awareness, supporting rapid prototyping, and fostering inter-disciplinarity. The discussion will include but not limited to the following six key research goals:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Promoting more sustainable and viable practices in development using CV software and physical materials.</li>
                        <li>Generating new tangible interactions by combining hardware and CV software techniques.</li>
                        <li>Enabling context awareness with CV for tangible interaction in non-stationary (e.g., mobile) settings.</li>
                        <li>Supporting rapid prototyping and exploratory uses of CV in TUI applications.</li>
                        <li>Leveraging existing CV toolkits and communication infrastructure for developing TUI applications.</li>
                        <li>Fostering collaborations, open-source and open-science practices, and knowledge exchanges across disciplines and within broader ecosystems.</li>
                    </ol>
                        
                    <p>We welcome designers, researchers, and practitioners from diverse backgrounds to submit a motivational statement with a provocative <strong>demo</strong> or <strong>poster</strong> that addresses at least one of the six research goals with physical artifacts as a workshop paper with 4 pages maximum formatted in PDF using the ACM Primary Article Templates.
                    </p>    
                    <p>Papers submitted to the workshop are reviewed by a jury committee, prioritizing quality and relevance. Accepted authors must register for the workshop and one day of the conference. Up to 24 participants will be selected based on submission ranking, provided with workshop materials, seats, and presentation slots, and involved in formal communication before and after the workshops. Additionally, we will open our demo and final presentation sessions for general participants who would like to join the workshop discussion. The authors and participants will be invited to extend their contributions to a special issue in the Journal of Behavior Information & Technology (BIT).
