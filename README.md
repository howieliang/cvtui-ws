## Welcome to the CV-TUI Workshop Series on **Designing Tangible Interaction with State-of-the-Art Computer Vision**

The CV-TUI Workshop Series on Designing Tangible Interaction with State-of-the-Art Computer Vision envisions a research agenda for extending the existing computer vision (CV) infrastructure for building tangible user interfaces (TUI). Recent advancements in CV have outpaced the capabilities of traditional image processing-based TUI toolkits like ReacTIVision. This has led to fragmented, bespoke solutions that hinder viability and sustainability in TUI development. Therefore, this workshop aims to take a co-creation approach to address six research goals, including promoting sustainable and viable practices, generating new interactions,  enabling context awareness, supporting exploratory uses, leveraging existing infrastructure, and fostering inter-disciplinarity.

The workshops will be maintained in this GitHub Repo.
