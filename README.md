## Welcome to the CHI 2025 Workshop on **Designing Tangible Interaction with State-of-the-Art Computer Vision**

The CHI 2025 Workshop on Designing Tangible Interaction with State-of-the-Art Computer Vision envisions a research agenda for extending the existing computer vision (CV) infrastructure for building tangible user interfaces (TUI). Recent advancements in CV have outpaced the capabilities of traditional image processing-based TUI toolkits like ReacTIVision. This has led to fragmented, bespoke solutions that hinder viability and sustainability in TUI development. Therefore, this workshop aims to take a co-creation approach to address six research goals, including promoting sustainable and viable practices, generating new interactions,  enabling context awareness, supporting exploratory uses, leveraging existing infrastructure, and fostering inter-disciplinarity.

## Position Paper Submission Deadline: Jan 22, 2025 (AoE) (Abstract Deadline: Jan 15, 2021 (AOE))
We welcome designers, researchers, and practitioners from diverse backgrounds to submit a motivational statement with a provocative **demo** or **poster** that addresses at least one of the six research goals with physical artifacts as a workshop paper with 4 pages maximum formatted in PDF using the ACM Primary Article Templates.

Papers submitted to the workshop are reviewed by a jury committee, prioritizing quality and relevance. Accepted authors must register for the workshop and one day of the conference. Up to 24 participants will be selected based on submission ranking, provided with workshop materials, seats, and presentation slots, and involved in formal communication before and after the workshops. Additionally, we will open our demo and final presentation sessions for general participants who would like to join the workshop discussion. The authors and participants will be invited to extend their contributions to a special issue in the Journal of \textit{Behavior Information \& Technology} (BIT).

**Submission Platform**	

All materials must be submitted electronically to **[EasyChair System]()** by the deadline.

## Organizers

**[Rong-Hao Liang]()** is an Assistant Professor in the Industrial Design Department and Electrical Engineering Departments at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. His research focuses on designing and engineering sensing systems and user interfaces for ubiquitous computing and embodied human-computer interaction.

**[Clement Zheng]()** is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Industrial Design at the National University of Singapore, Singapore. His work investigates computational design, tangible interactions, and making cultures. He is particularly interested in exploring alternative material approaches for designing interactive systems. His research findings are often presented in the form of new tools and approaches for building tangible interactions.

**[S. Sandra Bae]()** is a PhD candidate at the ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder, U.S.A. Her research interest focuses on pushing data beyond the traditional desktop setup and exploring how to materialize data. She has developed systematic toolkits on how data physicalizations can aid in analytics and data-sensemaking. 

**[Krithik Ranjan]()** is a PhD candidate at the ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder, U.S.A. His research explores computer vision techniques to develop low-cost tangible interfaces using everyday materials for learning and creating with computers in educational contexts.  

**[Hannah van Iterson]()** is a PhD candidate in the Industrial Design Department at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. Her work focuses on embedding sensors in everyday objects familiar to people, allowing them to engage and interact with the sensors more naturally and frequently, particularly in a healthcare setting. 

**[Mustafa Doga Dogan]()** is a Research Scientist at Adobe Research's AI Experiences Lab, Switzerland. His work focuses on embedding intelligence and interaction into everyday objects. He develops novel mechanisms to seamlessly identify, track, and interact with real-world objects for ubiquitous computing. Toward the vision of ubiquitous metadata, he uses methods in computer vision, digital fabrication, and machine learning to create applications in augmented reality (AR), product design, and digital product passports. 

**[Ken Nakagaki]()** is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Chicago, U.S.A. His research focuses on actuated tangible user interfaces to build and design engaging embodied interaction with actuation-integrated dynamic everyday environments.

**[Ellen Yi-Luen Do]()** is a Full Professor in the ATLAS Institute \& Computer Science CU Boulder, U.S.A. She invents at the intersections of people, design, and technology. She works on computational tools for design, especially sketching, creativity, and design cognition, including creativity support tools and design studies, tangible and embedded interaction and, most recently, computing for health and wellness.
